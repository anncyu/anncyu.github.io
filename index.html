                <p> Hi, my name is Ann. This is my first webpage! I'm currently in the MIMS program at UC Berkeley. I'm originally from Boulder, CO but have lived in the Midwest and East Coast as well. </p>
                <p> I went to the University of Michigan for my undergrad, where I studied public health. After graduating, I had the opportunity to work for a Fortune 10 company, CVS Health, for two years where I worked as a general management associate in Commercial Marketing and Virtual Care Solutions. </p>
                <p> Outside of school, I love exploring new cafes and restaurants. If I had more free time, I would love to travel more - Japan, Mexico, and Portugal are my dream destinations! </p>
